## EvtGraph
Code for "Creating a ScriptableObject Menu System in Unity" [YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/PQJyPsjOpUE)

## Installation
Can be installed via the Package Manager > Add Package From Git URL...

This repo has a dependency on the EvtVariable package which *MUST* be installed first. (From my understanding Unity does not allow git urls to be used as dependencies of packages)
`https://github.com/peartreegames/evt-variables.git`

then the repo can be added

`https://github.com/peartreegames/evt-menus.git`


## Notes
This system is more of an experiment than a fully fleshed out solution, but I think it has promise.
